Tasks
Task 0: Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
In this task, I created a GitHub account and set up a Personal Access Token to have access to my repositories. I also created my first repository named "alx-zero_day," and cloned it to my local machine to add a README.md file.

Task 1: Repo-session
I created a new directory named 0x03-git in my alx-zero_day repository and added a README.md file to both the root of the repository and the 0x03-git directory. I made sure to commit and push my changes to GitHub.

Task 2: Coding fury road
In this task, I created three directories at the root of my alx-zero_day repository named bash, c, and js. I also created the following files in the respective directories:

c/c_is_fun.c
js/main.js
js/index.js
bash/alx
bash/school
I added all the new files to Git and committed my changes with the message "Starting to code today, so cool" before pushing to GitHub.

Task 3: Collaboration is the base of a company
In this task, I worked with a partner to collaborate on a project. We created a branch named update_script and added a script file named 98. We also added our team's task progress to a README.md file and made sure to push our changes to GitHub...edited
